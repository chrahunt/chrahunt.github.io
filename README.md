To run locally, `bundle install` then `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

`bundle install` might require DevKit to build native extensions on Windows. Install by going to RubyInstaller page, downloading relevant version of DevKit, and installing per instructions.

On long-lived local versions, make sure to update jekyll periodically with `bundle update`.
